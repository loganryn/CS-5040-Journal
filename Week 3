This week, I covered modules 2, 3 and part of 4. 

I struggled with the O(n) comparisons. Here is what I learned

* most important, 2^n. This grows extremely fast
* second most, n^2 or another power > 1
* anything with n as a coeficient
* sqrt n
* log n
* multiple log n

I was able to code most of Project 2 this week, but I am having trouble passing webcat tests. I think it is likely due to syntax 
errors like with project 1. 

I am getting more familiar with Java, but still have to look things up quite often. 

* regex was the big one this week

I also researched the details for post and pre order traversals to answer a question on piazza that had gone unanswered regarding 
traversals with more than 2 children.
